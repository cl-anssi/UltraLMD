# Inductive Lateral Movement Detection in Enterprise Computer Networks

This repository contains the code associated with our ESANN submission
"Inductive lateral movement detection in enterprise computer networks".
It is based on a fork from the ULTRA project, which we use for lateral
movement detection in our work.
We added scripts and configuration files enabling reproduction of the
experiments presented in the paper, including data preprocessing,
baseline models and implementation of our ULTRA-based anomaly detection
method.
